  Even after the massive increase in computational capability over the past two decades and many algorithmic improvements, rendering still remains far from a solved problem. Greater capabilities of renderers have translated into more complex scenes and more accurate simulation of light transport and scattering rather than rendering the same old thing, just faster. We believe that innovation in sampling and rendering algorithms will become increasingly important in the coming years, especially as further performance benefits from computer hardware improvements become increasingly hard-won as Moore's law slows.

  即使在过去二十年中计算能力大幅提升以及许多算法改进之后，渲染问题仍然远未解决。 渲染器更强大的能力转化为更复杂的场景和更精确的光传输和散射模拟，而不是仅仅更快地渲染相同的内容。 我们相信，在采样和渲染算法上的创新在未来几年将变得越来越重要，特别是随着摩尔定律的放缓，计算机硬件改进带来的性能收益变得越来越难以获得。

  The recent addition of specialized ray-tracing hardware to GPUs has opened a new chapter for path tracing, broadening the set of developers who are able to consider using the technique. Innovation generally progresses at a rate related to the number of people working in an area and so we very much look forward to the new ideas that the real-time graphics community will bring to path tracing in the coming years.
